# Code Review Reflection

As a quick reminder, here are the coding practices we discussed:
- Comment your code.
- Structure your code with proper indentation.
- Validate your code (HTML & CSS).
- Use lower case for coding elements (HTML & CSS).
- Keep style and structure separate.
- Use start and end tags or empty tags. Avoid using start tags for empty tags.
- Use descriptive ID and class names.
- Avoid nearly identical code: Don't copy and paste code.

> After reviewing your code, what do you think your code did well?

I think my code was neat, and easy to read. I think it also achieved the goal of the assignment.


> What do you need to improve in your code?

My code might have included extraneous parts that I didn't need.


> Are there other principles you have been following or found useful that weren't listed in class?

I've found it useful to just ask my friends about how they make sure their code is tidy.
