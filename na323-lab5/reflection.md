# Reflection for Lab 5

## Which version of the website was your group given (A, B, or C)?
> Place an x between inside the square brackets. Example: [x]

- [x ] Website A

    Cornell has asked you to build a website for helping current undergraduates plan trips home for breaks. They're not sure what students are looking for, so they've tasked you with gathering information and creating the website.

- [ ] Website B

    The City of Ithaca wants to encourage Ithaca undergraduate students to engage with local businesses rather than just buying everything from online retailers. To do this, they've asked you to create a website to inform students about local businesses and encourage them to shop at these businesses.

- [ ] Website C

    Cornell has asked you to build a website to inform current undergraduates about construction, closures, and events on campus that may impact them (think sidewalk closures on East Ave or Dragon Day). They have asked you to find out what information would be helpful to students and create a website with this information.

## Interview Questions
> What interview questions did you come up with?

1. Recall the last time you went home for a break.

2. What type of break was it? (fall break, thanksgiving break, winter break, etc.)

3. Recall how you had planned on traveling home. (What steps did you take?)

## Reflection
> What useful and relevant information did you get from your interview? (1 paragraph)

I learned that most people I interviewed went home for thanksgiving and winter break. Many of them traveled by bus, although answers varied (but all answers were useful). I also learned that many people used a relatively small set of bus companies for their travels, and many people compared prices of different bus companies. People cared about getting the cheapest price in a time window that met their needs.


> What information did you get that was not useful or relevant? (1 paragraph)

I got some anectodal responses that didn't give me the information I was looking for-- the first question often led participants to give long winded and tangential responses. Although the first and last question worked nicely together because it helped me get an idea of how much that was planned actually happened. The information I received was mostly relevant-- but people could get carried away by the first question.


> Which of your questions need improvement based on the value of the responses they got? (1 sentence about each question)

My first question needs to be refined more, and reworded to be clear that I wasn't looking for long, or funny stories, and was just looking for information; how it is right now elicited wordy responses. My second question got the exact information as I was looking for, even though it was a simple quesion, I believe it was very useful. My third question also achieved its goal, and  also had the additional benefit that many people compared the steps they took in their planning process to what actually happened; maybe I could reword the question to get more of these comparison-type responses.
