# Rationale For Lab Homework 3

## What were the emotions/ideas you wanted to convey?

I would like for the site to be a family friendly space. since it's a "rules" page, I'd like for there to be an official nature, and I would like it to command authority, on some level, but it's also important to keep in mind that this, at the end of the day, is a webpage for a zoo, and so it should still be somewhat lighthearted.

## How did you use CSS styling to theme the site with that emotion/idea?

I used CSS to change the colors of the background, and fonts, and to additionally style the text. I chose colors that stood out against one another, to improve legibility, and also to call attention to the important information conveyed. However, I also wanted to make sure that it wasn't super serious, or intimidating, and so the colors I chose overall help create a more relaxing feel.
