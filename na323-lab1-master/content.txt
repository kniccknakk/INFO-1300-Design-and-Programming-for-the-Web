Ithaca Zoo

Welcome!

We're so excited to share our love of animals with our neighbors, and we hope you come visit soon. Whether you stop by once while you're passing through town or come multiple times a week, you'll find the Ithaca Zoo is ready to welcome you with open arms.

Advisory: due to upcoming hot weather, we advise all guests to make sure they bring sunscreen for protection from ultraviolet rays and a water bottle to help stay hydrated. We have water fountains all over the zoo where you can fill up. Just look for the signs that say "Watering Hole."

Events

Our next event is the Red Panda Meet and Greet, where you have a chance to meet our favorite little bundles of joy, Red and Fluffy. This will take place next Saturday from 1:00-4:30 PM. There will be a line, so come early.
